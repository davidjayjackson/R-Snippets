How can I calculate a weekly total in base R? I'm thinking sapply? Now I did see one example using the as.Date function?

create another variable extracting i.e. week number and year. you can use tappy, aggregate, or by to use these two variables to calculate a statistic for your target variable.

Maybe something like mutate(week = floor_date(date, unit=“week”))%>% group_by(week) %>% summarise(sum(whatever))
