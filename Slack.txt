How can I calculate a weekly total in base R? I'm thinking sapply? Now I did see one example using the as.Date function?

romunov @ Slack
create another variable extracting i.e. week number and year. you can use tappy, aggregate, or by to use these two variables to calculate a statistic for your target variable.

Maybe something like mutate(week = floor_date(date, unit=“week”))%>% group_by(week) %>% summarise(sum(whatever))


Question:
In "base R (only)"how do I use lag to extract the new cases for each date ? I've tried this:

Andrew @ Slack

US$lag_cases = lag(US$cases, 1) then US[1,5] = US[1,2] then to US$new_cases = US$cases - US$lag_cases

Question: How can I do a count by group in Base R?

If you have a dataframe like iris you could count the number of rows after a split:
lapply(split(iris, factor(iris$Species)), nrow)

So you split by a factor and that gives you a list of dataframes that you use lapply to apply the function nrow over. The output is a list of numbers, you could unlist this and get an array of numbers that you could use further downstream

also you could do the following:  table(iris$Species)

which also works if you have more grouping vars, e.g. with(mtcars, as.data.frame(table(cyl, gear)))
